# WhatsApp Chat Analysis
## Source of the Data
In WhatsApp there is an 'Export Chat' option.This gives you the access to your chat history preferably a group chat which you can export to your email with or without media data in the form of '.txt' file.I did not upload the '.txt' file of my whatsapp group chat due to some privacy issues.
## Overview
An analysis has been done using a group chat taken from my WhatsApp account.Meaningful insights have been drawn using bar charts during the analysis of this group chat.All the steps are clearly mentioned in the jupyter notebook.
## Motivation
I was always curious to know who is the most garrulous person in our group or at what time our group is most active.All these questions were answered after the analysis of this group chat.
